# On My Way 3/3

For this challenge, you'll have to find the exit point, from a start position, in a 3D map.

`prog.pwnme.fr 7002`

This time, there will be obstacles to avoid, represented by `X`

Example:

```
000
0X0
0X0
-
000
000
SXE
-
000
X0X
000
-
```

A possible answer is: `y+;x+;x+;y-`

You don't have to find the shortest path.
